All the documentation related files are located at OF-controller/doc

Requirements
-------------
1. libncurses
   libedit
   liburcu
   libcrypto
   libfutex

2. All of the above libraries can be downloaded from opensource and can be linked  as shared libraries.
   All of these are copied to of-controller/src/ofproto/build/lib-p4080, of-controller/src/ofproto/build/lib-x86 directory as a reference.

3. All the opensource source code is placed at OF-controller/opensrc directory.

4. While compilation you may observe issues with ant-tool. Install the ant-tool on the development machine.
   apt-get install ant

5. Check softlink which java ->/usr/bin/java --> /etc/alternatives/java --> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java
   if not install sun java6 for ubuntu 12.04 from the Internet, and update the java soft-link as mentioned above.

   For 64 bit machine  apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

Compilation Procedure 
-----------------------

1. Update JAVA_HOME,PATH,CLASSPATH in the respective shell script mentioned below.

2. For P4080, Upate the SDK_INSTALL_PATH in p4080-sdk-1.4-env.sh This source has used QorIQ SDK v1.4 
   Browse through the website for the SDK1.4 http://linux.freescale.net/labDownload2/viewDownloads.php
   source p4080-sdk-1.4-env.sh

3. For X86 32 bit, run source x86-env.sh
       X86 64 bit, run source x86-64bit-env.sh

4. make controller

Installation
-------------
1. make controllerimage 
   which will create ondirector-image.tar.gz, copy ondirector-image.tar.gz on to the target machine (Not to / directory).

2. untar ondirector-image.tar.gz.

3. cd ondirector-install
   sh ondirector-install.sh

4. cd /ondirector
   sh ondirector-start.sh 

NOTE: controller is running on 6653 by default, user can change the port number to his desired one by modifying the line as follows in ondirector-start.sh and restart the controller
./controller 0 8 -f &  ==> ./controller 0 8 6633 -f &

Binary files
-------------
1. All the binary files are placed in /ondirector/bin directory
   cd /ondirector/bin
    controller  ofcli  ofucmd  ofldsvd

2. controller, ofldsvd  and ofucmd are started as part of the start script.

3. To configure controller through CLI, run ofcli.
   Refer ofp-configure.txt file in OF-controller/doc directory.

Application Shared Libraries
-----------------------------
1. All application libraries are placed in /ondirector/lib/apps
   cd /ondirector/lib/apps
   s01-l3ext-utils.so s02-sample-app.so

2. s02-sample-app.so is a sample application library which is capable of handling the session-table, forwarding-table and arp-table entries.

3. For Sample application configuration, refer ofp-sampleapp.txt file in OF-controller/doc directory. 

LDSV - Default configuration
-----------------------------
1. LDSV will load the default configuration from /ondirector/conf/ofpsdn directory, when the controller is started initially.
2. When the user issued save command in CLI, the configuration is updated and stored in the /ondirector/conf/<VERSION_NUM>/ofpsdn.
3. The updated configuration will be loaded when the controller is restarted.
