		It creates a hash table and adds the new virtual network node represented

		table provides a static view to the VN database using the argument nw_name.
	       	Separate API is provided to add dynamic views to the VN database by adding 
		attributes to the virtual network nodes.
		The input arguments tenant_name and subnet_name are used to obtain the safe 
		references of tenant node and subnet network respectively. A handle to the 
		added VN node is returned so that it can be used for faster reference. 

		A VN notification of the type CRM_VN_ADDED is sent to the registered Applications.

		The argument config_info contains the parameters required for configuring the 
		Virtual Network.

\Param[in]	config_info_p - Virtual Network configuration information. 
\Param[in]	nw_name - Name of the virtual network to be added. This shall be unique. 
\Param[in]	tenant_name -  Tenant to which this VN belongs.
\Param[in]	nw_type -  The network types, supported at present are VLAN_TYPE and VXLAN_TYPE.
\Param[in]	nw_id - VLAN_ID or VXLAN_VNI based on nw_type.
\Param[in]	vxlan_service_port - Service port if nw_type is VXLAN.
\Param[in] 	subnet_name - IP Address range assigned to the virtual network. It may be added using modify API.

\Param[in]	optional - nw_desc - Description of the virtual network to be added.
\Param[in]	optional - vn_operational_status -  VN_ACTIVE = 1, VN_INACTIVE = 0 
\Param[in]	optional - provider_physical_network_p - Name of the provider's physical network say "physnet1"
\Param[in]	optional - vn_admin_state_up - TRUE or FALSE
\Param[in] 	optional - router_external - TRUE or FALSE 

\Param[out]	output_vn_handle_p - Handle to the virtual network node.

		- Invalid parameter value.
