 * Following are the steps for Applications to send messages to datapath
 * 1. Allocate message descriptor by using ofu_alloc_message() API.
 *    As part of APIs to send messages, steps are explained to find the length 
 *    of the message to allocate.
 * 2. Call all necessary utility APIs to build required parameters like match fields, instructions,
 *    actions, etc in the message buffer.
 * 3. And then call actual API to build Open Flow message and send message to datapath.
