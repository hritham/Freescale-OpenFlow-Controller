CBENCH for OpenFlow 1.3 Controllers

================================================================
1. Introduction:-

		Controller bench marker (Cbench) is a program for testing OpenFlow controllers by generating PACKET_IN events for new flows. Cbench emulates switch instances which connect to the controller. It sends PACKET_IN messages, and watches for FLOW_MOD messages to get pushed down. Cbench is helpful to measure performance impact when controller source is being changed.

		Cbench1.3 supports throughput and latency evaluation of OpenFlow1.3 controllers. It simulates fake switches, sends in PACKET_IN messages and expects either of FLOW MOD/PACKET OUT from the controller. Cbench1.3 does not support backward compatibility with OpenFlow1.0 controllers but works only with OpenFlow1.3 controllers.

2. Capabilities of Cbench:-

	a) Measures two performance factors by emulating approximately 1000 fake switches.
	b) Measures throughput (flows per second) and latency (the delay between packet arrival and corresponding PACKET_IN) of controllers.

3. Changes made to Cbench to make it work with 1.3:-
	a) In OpenFlow1.0, the switch initiates HELLO packet contrast to the controller initiating HELLO packet in OpenFlow1.3. Changes will be made accordingly.
	b) Features Reply and Packet in messages initiated from the switch are changed to fit into OpenFlow1.3 header format.

4. Installing Cbench:-

	a) Go to openflow/oflops directory.
	b) Execute ./configure with-openflow-src-dir=../ 
	c) Run make and make install commands to build cbench binary.

5. Running Cbench:-

	The following illustrates running of cbench command:

# ./cbench -c <controller-ip>  -s <number-of switches> -m 10000  -l 10  -t

	To get complete cbench help execute the following command:
# ./cbench -h
